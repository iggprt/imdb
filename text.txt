It is characterized by prevailing northwinds with winds from the south and south-east in the hot season. Due to its location at the junction of the provinces Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania, it has been an important road and railway junction since ancient times.

History[edit]

Monument to victims of World War I
In the northern part of the town a settlement from the Bronze Age was discovered which dates roughly to the second millennium BC and belongs to Monteoru culture. Geto-Dacian vestiges of 5th century BC were also found here.

The first mention of the town is made by its Hungarian name Egyedhalma (“in oppido nostro Egydhalm” meaning "in our city Gilles’ Hill") in a Latin language document from 1433[1] where Iliaş of Moldavia granted commercial privileges to Transylvanian Saxon merchants. The Romanian name derives from the Hungarian one. The original name supports the idea that the town was esteblished by Hungarian Csángós settled in Moldavia as part of a systematic Hungarian imperial policy to settle Hungarian and partly German population in places of strategic economic, commercial and military importance with the task to control and defend the eastern frontier of Hungary.[2][3] It was declared a city in 1948.
